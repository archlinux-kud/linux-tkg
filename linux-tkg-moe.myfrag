# When adding a new config override to this file, please make sure that:
# * It belongs to correct categorization and sorted alphabetically, if possible
# * Disabled entries (starts with "#" and contains "is not set" phrase) must be
#   put before any other entries that enable or modify existing entry in config
#
# On linux-tkg, contents of this file (and all other *.myfrag files) are
# appended as it is into main kernel config file after olddefconfig (which in
# turn runs after linux-tkg initial modifications being set). If there are
# entries that don't exist originally due to user patches or changes within
# upstream kernel source that don't immediately get reflected in linux-tkg,
# you still need to confirm choices for those missing entries beforehand.

# Use SHA3-512 instead of SHA-512 for kernel module signing infrastructure,

# vulnerable to all attacks that affect previous standards.
#
# For older Linux kernel versions, SHA-384 is used instead since truncated
# versions of SHA-2 are not suspectible to length extension attacks, but this
# SHA-2 choice ends up being a personal preference than anything else.

# MODULE_SIG_HASH is overridden with an empty value in this config fragment
